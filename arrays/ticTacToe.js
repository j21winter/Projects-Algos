// For this weekend challenge, consider the game Tic-Tac-Toe.
// How would you represent a 3x3 game board: specifically, whether each square is unoccupied or claimed by a player? 
// Could you represent this with an array? 
// What would the array contain? 
// Is there a benefit from having an array of arrays?

// Once you have a good design in mind, create a function that, given one of these gameboards,
// automatically determines and returns the overall state of the game. 
// A game is always in one of five different states – 
    // one state might be “Player 1’s turn”; 
    // another might be “Game over: player 2 has won.”

// Once you have mastered that, can you extend this function to handle gameboards of arbitrary size?

const gameBoard = [ 
    [null, null, null],
    [null, null, null],
    [null, null, null]
                ]

function ticTacToe(){
    // State will change based on the status of the game
    let state = ended 

    let player1, player2

    // let players pick X or O
    // let the players pick who starts

    while(state = active){
        
    }
    // enter the game
    // print the board with ABC x and 123 y to identify the squares
    // promt() for input
    // validate input
    // run a check for a three in a row
    // ask for next player turn.

    // once a winner has been determined, or board has been filled GAME OVER
    // offer restart
